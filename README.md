## Overview:  
Pulse is a web based fitness app which creates personalised workout plans generated by AI. Upon onboarding, it will ask users a number of questions regarding their goals, weight, height, experience, available equipment and lifestyle. Pulse AI will generate a workout plan tailored to their needs. It will adapt plans over time, track progress, and keep users motivated through simple gamification.

## Problem Statement:
Current fitness apps provide very generic and static workout routines which donâ€™t adapt to a user's progress or circumstances (Injuries etc). Beginners can feel overwhelmed, and experienced lifters lack the ongoing personalisation.

## Core features: 
User Onboarding and Profile: Collects fitness goals, lifestyle details, and user preferences.

**AI Workout Planner:** Generates custom workout routines using the OpenAI API, orchestrated by Langflow.
**Progress Tracking:** Monitors workout sessions, key metrics, and displays progress through visual graphs.
**Motivation:** Incorporates gamification elements such as streaks, badges, and milestones.
**Adaptive Plans:** AI dynamically adjusts workout plans based on user feedback and logged results.

### Additional Features
**Calendar Component:** Allows users to select any date to view specific data, including workouts, water intake, and weight, presented in clear, visual charts.
**Badges and Achievements:** Engage users by awarding badges for consistent training, hydration, and achieving weight loss goals.

### Git commit message types

**feat:** Introducing new features or significant improvements. 
**fix:** Bug fixes that resolve issues in your code. docs: Updates or additions to documentation. 
**style:** Cosmetic changes that don't affect code functionality (like formatting). 
**refactor:** Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature but improve structure. 
**test:** Everything about testing - adding or fixing tests. 
**chore:** Routine tasks or updates to the build process. 
**perf:** Enhancements that improve performance. 
**ci:** Modifications related to CI/CD processes. build: Changes affecting the build system or external dependencies. 
**revert:** Undoing previous changes.

### Git Flow / Branches Brach types, their distinct role, and the naming conventions:

**main:** The source of truth for production-ready states. 
**develop:** The integration branch for development work. 
**feature/:** For developing new features, e.g., feature/add-login. 
**release/:** Preparing a new production release, e.g., release/1.2.0. 
**hotfix/:** Quick fixes for the production version, e.g., hotfix/critical-login-bug. 
**support/:** Long-term support for older versions, e.g., support/1.x. 
**bugfix/:** For specific bug fixes (optional), e.g., bugfix/login-error.
